#Comments begin with the number sign (#), can start anywhere on a line and continue until
#the end of the line. Comments must be separated from other tokens by whitespace characters. 
#If characters appear inside of a string, then they are number sign (#) literals.

#Scalar content can be written in block notation, using a literal style (indicated by “|”) 
#where all line breaks are significant. Alternatively, they can be written with the folded 
#style (denoted by “>”) where each line break is folded to a space unless it ends an empty 
#or a more-indented line.

#       It said on the door

#   Blank lines denote
#   paragraph breaks

#List members are denoted by a leading hyphen (-) with one member per line.
shopping_list:
  - tea
  - milk
  - coffee

#A list can also be specified by enclosing text in square brackets ([...]) with each entry
#separated by a comma. Example below
list:
  - ["Item 1", "Item2"]
  - ["Item 3", "Item3"]
  - [name, age, skills]: [John, 34, a lot of things]
employees:
  - name: John Smith
    age: 33
  - name: John Doe
    age: 41

#An associative array can also be specified by text enclosed in curly braces ({...}), with
#keys separated from values by colon and the entries separated by commas (spaces are not 
#required to retain compatibility with JSON).
example2:
  - {name: John Smith, age: 33}
  - {name: John Doe, age: 41}
  - ["Item 1", "Item2"]

#YAML requires the colon be followed by a space so that url-style strings like 
#http://www.wikipedia.org can be represented without needing to be enclosed in quotes.

#Strings (one type of scalar in YAML) are ordinarily unquoted, but may be enclosed in double
#-quotes ("), or single-quotes (').
